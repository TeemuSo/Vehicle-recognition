# Vehicle-recognition competition

This work was jointly done with few collaborators. Myself I wrote the whole skeleton for the data importing to model processing. After the pipelines were working, we tested different types of models, and found the best performing one.

This code isn't particularly well formatted, but it acts as an example of of how I've previously worked with convolutional neural networks.
